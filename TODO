The .o files are deleted at the end of the make process.  Make has to recompile everything if one file changes because of this.

Compiling process:
    - Write an SConstruct so people can compile with either Make or Scons
    - Maybe make levmar optional
    - Commands which only do compiling are given linking flags.  This generates warnings that may look like important errors to some people.

For McAllister method:
    - Write Jacobian and give it to levmar
    - Lookup table for minimization function
    - Statistics on what takes the longest in the levmar call
    - Specify options to levmar to change the termination conditions
    - Try out Gauss-Newton.  It will probably be faster.  The only problem that
      could occur is if the starting value is not close enough, but it should
      be fine.
    - Try different starting values.

Features to Implement:
    - Option for jpg output, avi output, or viewing window output
    - Video input
