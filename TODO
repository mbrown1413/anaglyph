Compiling process:
    - Write an SConstruct so people can compile with either Make or Scons
    - Commands which only do compiling are given linking flags.  This generates
      warnings that may look like important errors to some people.  This
      happens on Mac's compiler, but not Linux's.
    - Maybe make levmar optional
    - The .o files are deleted at the end of the make process.  Make has to
      recompile everything if one file changes because of this.

For CIELab method:
    - Try out Gauss-Newton.  It will probably be faster.  The only problem that
      could occur is if the starting value is not close enough, but it should
      be fine.
    - Try more starting values.

Features to Implement:
    - Option to sepecify the fps of resulting video.
